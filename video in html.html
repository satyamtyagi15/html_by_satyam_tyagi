    <h1>Insert the video in html </h1>
    <h3>for inserting video you first need to
         upload the video to your editor let's say 
         vs code  copy the video to your html folder 
        and then upload it to your webpage by specifing
         the src in your video tag and don't forget to
         use controls word to let the users control the 
        video </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <video >
            <source src="/sample.mp4.mp4">
        </video>
        <br>
        <h2>umm so you guys maybe thinking that it's not looking
            like a video it's looking like an image but it's 
            actually a video the difference is that we don't have any controls right now </h2> 
            <br> 
            <h3>now let's add a video to your html by using the control attribute too </h3>
            <video controls>
                <source src="/sample.mp4.mp4">
            </video>
            <br>
            <h3>now if i want the video to be autoplay  loop and mute we can use autoplay 
                loop and mute attribute for that </h3>
            <br>
            <video controls autoplay loop muted >
                <source src="/sample.mp4.mp4">
            </video>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>similar thing can be done for audio file too </h3>
            <audio src="/audio.mp3" controls autoplay loop muted></audio>
